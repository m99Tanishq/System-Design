flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code

1.Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2.Open/Closed Principle
3.Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle (LSP)
4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5.Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

1. S ->
A class should have only one reason to change
means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.

class Marker {
     String name;
     String color;
     int year;
     int price;

     public Marker(String name, String color, int year, int price){
     this.name = name;
     this.color = color;
     this.year = year;
     this.price = price;
     }
}

class Invoice {
     private Marker marker;
     private int quantity;

     public Invoice(Marker marker, int quantity){
     this.marker = marker;
     this.quantity = quantity;
     }

     public int calculateTotal() {
     int price = (marker.price) * this.quantity;
     return price;
     }

     public void printInvoice() {
     // Something
     }
}

Now here we have 2 function in class Invoice but there a two reason to change that don't follow 1st.
Instead we have

class Invoice {
     private Marker marker;
     private int quantity;

     public Invoice(Marker marker, int quantity){
     this.marker = marker;
     this.quantity = quantity;
     }

     public int calculateTotal() {
     int price = (marker.price) * this.quantity;
     return price;
     }
}

class printInvoice {
     private Invoice invoice;

     public printInvoice(Invoice invoice){
     this.invoice = invoice;
     }

     public void printInvoice() {
     // Something
     }
}

2. OCP ->
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

class InvoiceDao {
      Invoice invoice;

      public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice){
      this.invoice = invoice;
      }

      public void saveToDB(){
      // Something
      }
}

Now new Request to Save it To File Also, Instead of adding a new function in the InvoiceDao class we will make a interface which we will implements and will add different functionality as to save the data,
...

interface InvoiceDao{
      public void save(Invoice invoice);
}

class DatabaseInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{
      @Override
      public void save(Invoice invoice){
       // save to DB
      }
}

class FileInvoiceDao implements InvoiceDao{
      @Override
      public void save(Invoice invoice){
       // save to File
      }
}
